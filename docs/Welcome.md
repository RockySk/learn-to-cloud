Learn to Cloud (L2C) is a comprehensive courseware that maps out the journey to becoming a junior cloud engineer. [Originating from a viral tweet](https://twitter.com/madebygps/status/1406258053427740672?lang=en), it has evolved into a robust learning platform that provides:

- Curated learning resources
- Theoretical foundations
- Hands-on labs

One thing that makes L2C different is how we designed it. Yes, we give you content and exercises, but we also leave some gaps on purpose. Why? Because we want you to:

- Learn to solve problems on your own
- Get good at finding answers
- Figure out real-world issues like you would on the job

You'll need to complete each phase before moving to the next one. This way, you'll build a solid foundation in cloud engineering. By combining what we teach you with the stuff you figure out on your own, you'll be better prepared for an actual cloud engineering job.

## What do you need to know before starting?

L2C is open source and free, and the resources we recommend are either free or very affordable.
The only requirements are motivation and discipline - these are aspects we cannot provide for you.

Our guide is constantly updated to meet market demands and is maintained by professionals who actively work in the cloud engineering space. For updates please follow [GPS](https://x.com/madebygps), [Rishab](https://x.com/rishabincloud), and [L2C](https://x.com/learntocloud) on X

Breaking into tech has never been easy, despite what some content creators might suggest. This journey will be challenging, but if you have a genuine interest in cloud engineering, it will be worth your effort.

Good luck on your journey!
