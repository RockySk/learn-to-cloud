Learn to Cloud (L2C) is a junior cloud engineering courseware that originated from a [viral tweet](https://twitter.com/madebygps/status/1406258053427740672). It provides:

- Curated learning resources
- Theoretical foundations
- Hands-on labs

One thing that makes L2C different is how we designed it,, we left some gaps on purpose. Why? Because we want you to:

- Learn to solve problems on your own
- Get good at finding answers
- Figure out real-world issues like you would on the job

The program uses a phase-based approach where each section builds on previous knowledge. By combining structured content with independent problem-solving, students develop real-world cloud engineering capabilities.

## What do you need to know before starting?

The only requirements are motivation and discipline - these are aspects we cannot provide for you.
L2C is open source and free, and the resources we recommend are either free or very affordable.
Breaking into tech has never been easy, despite what some content creators might suggest. This journey will be challenging, but if you have a genuine interest in cloud engineering, it will be worth your effort.


Our guide is constantly updated to meet market demands and is maintained by professionals who actively work in the cloud engineering space. For updates please follow [GPS](https://x.com/madebygps), [Rishab](https://x.com/rishabincloud), and [L2C](https://x.com/learntocloud) on X.
