# Welcome



Learn to Cloud (L2C) is a junior cloud engineering courseware built on the belief that anyone can learn foundational cloud engineering skills with the right guide and discipline. 
Our platform is intentionally:

- **designed to guide, not handhold**

    We provide essential details while leaving intentional gaps to foster critical thinking, problem-solving, and self-sufficiency.

- **focused on practice with purpose**

    L2C balances hands-on learning with carefully integrated theory to promote intentional learning rather than passive progression.

- **constantly evolving**

    As technology changes, so does our guide. Expect updates that keep it relevant and aligned with industry standards.

## Cost?

No cost, no account needed, nothing. You have no excuses. L2C is open source and free, and the resources we recommend are either free or very affordable.

## I have questions

Ask questions in [Discord](https://discord.learntocloud.guide)

For updates follow [GPS](https://x.com/madebygps), [Rishab](https://x.com/rishabincloud), and [L2C](https://x.com/learntocloud) on X.


## What do you need to know before starting?

The only requirements are motivation and discipline - these are aspects we cannot provide for you.

Breaking into tech has never been easy, despite what some content creators might suggest. This journey will be challenging, but if you have a genuine interest in cloud engineering, it will be worth your effort.


Good luck on your journey!
