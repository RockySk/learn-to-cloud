## Where to start?

As a junior cloud engineer, figuring out where to start when it comes to cloud security can be daunting and highly overwhelming.

But remember you are not alone.

The biggest thing you can takeaway is that cloud security is not the job of a single individual (even if you are the lead senior cloud security engineer). Security principles need to be followed with everything you do and everything your team does.

Security should be baked in not bolted on.
