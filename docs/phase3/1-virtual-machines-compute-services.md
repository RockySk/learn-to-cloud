# Topic 1: Virtual Machines and Compute Services
Virtualization and compute services are fundamental to cloud engineering, enabling scalable and flexible infrastructure. In this topic, you will focus on deploying virtual machines on various cloud providers (such as AWS, Azure, and GCP)

- Study 
  - What are [Compute Services](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/compute/)
  - Understanding [Virtualization](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/virtualization/)
  - Instance Types & OS Selection: Choosing the right VM specs (CPU, RAM, storage)
  - Deploying Virtual Machines on [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html), [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/) or [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute#create-your-first-vm)


## Test your knowledge

Test your knowledge with an AI assistant, here are some example prompts to test your knowledge of Virtualization and Compute Services:

1. Can you explain what Compute Services are and why they are important in cloud computing?
2. Can you describe how virtualization works and its role in cloud infrastructure?
3. Can you differentiate between Virtualization and Compute Services.
4. Can you compare the compute services provided by AWS, Azure, and GCP?
5. Can you explain what a hypervisor is, how it works, and why it is essential for virtualization?


## Hands-on Tasks
Deploy a Virtual Machine on any cloud provider using the default configuration.
