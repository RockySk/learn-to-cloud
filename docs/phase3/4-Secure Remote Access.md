# Topic 4: Secure Remote Access
In the previous topic, you learned about cloud networking fundamentals, including VPCs, subnets, and traffic flow. Now, the focus is on understanding secure remote access mechanisms that protect cloud resources from unauthorized access.

- Study
    
    - Session-based access management: Using cloud-native services like [AWS Systems Manager Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html), [Azure Bastion](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/), and [GCP IAP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfxf2LdsXfs)


## Test Your Knowledge
Once you are done with the provided resources, check this out [here](https://awstip.com/aws-dont-ssh-into-your-public-bastion-use-ssm-session-manager-instead-a5b527f8db41)
Once you are done studying, test your understanding with these prompts:

- What are the different secure remote access methods in cloud environments?
- What are the advantages of using a session-based access tool (e.g., AWS SSM, Azure Bastion, or GCP IAP) instead of direct SSH/RDP?


## Hands-on Task
- Configure session-based access for remote servers using AWS SSM, Azure Bastion, or GCP IAP
- Apply IAM policies to enforce least privilege access for remote users
